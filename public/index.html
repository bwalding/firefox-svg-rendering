    <p>
        There is a bug on Firefox with strict CSP rules (which is what GitHub uses
        from their Camo service). The end-result is that images render without
        inline styles (colour / gradients) being shown, thus yielding black logos.
        It is very unclear as to why this happens - but it seems to be CSP +
        Firefox + &lt;picture/&gt; elements interacting in a way that was not
        immediately obvious. Reproduction is straightforward: `make server` and
        then load http://localhost:8000/ in your Firefox browser - many of the
        images will be blacked out (doing a forced reload fixes the issue!).
