        There seems to be a bug in Firefox with strict CSP rules (which is what GitHub uses
        from their Camo service).
    </p>
    <p> The end-result is that images render without
        inline styles (colour / gradients) being shown, thus yielding black logos.
    </p>

    <p> This problem does not occur in Chrome / Safari</p>
